python_projects_basic_to_advanced

The goal is to create 30 small 'apps' 'projects' in total, first projects will be using very basics of pythons and I will move on to advanced Python coding.

The idea of this 30 days code challange was taken from a Udemy instructor Dr. Angela Yu, here is the link for her Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I believe that I already have good coding skills in Python, but practice makes it better, so I have decided to start this challenge on Feb 17, 2023 to March 16th, 2023.

Happy Coding :)
